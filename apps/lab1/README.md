As a part of your handin, modify `apps/lab1/README.md` to report the
median number of retries (for 100 trials) when the drop probability is:

* 0.001 (i.e., 0.1%): 8
* 0.005 (i.e., 0.5%): 8
* 0.01 (i.e, 1%): 8
* 0.05 (i.e., 5%): 9
* 0.1 (i.e., 10%): 9
* 0.2 (i.e., 20%): 10
* 0.5 (i.e., 50%): 14.5

Also report any conclusions you can draw from these observations.
The number of retries increases as drop rate increases, but the number of retries increases more slowly than the drop rate.
